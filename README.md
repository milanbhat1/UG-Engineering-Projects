### 5. Air Quality Monitoring System using STM32 (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/AirQualityMonitor-STM32  
Built a cost-effective air quality monitoring device using the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) microcontroller and MQ-135 gas sensor. The system measures gas concentration in PPM, processes data via ADC, and displays real-time values on an OLED using I2C communication.

---

### 6. Battery Management System (BMS) using STM32 (2025)
🔗 https://github.com/milanbhat1/BatteryManagementSystem-STM32  
Developed a Battery Management System that monitors battery voltage and current, estimates State of Charge (SOC), and displays real-time parameters on an OLED. The system incorporates protection logic with audible and visual alerts for low SOC and abnormal current conditions.
