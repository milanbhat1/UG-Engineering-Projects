## 2nd yr:
 ### 1. [Cardio Track](https://github.com/milanbhat1/low-power-ecg-circuit) -2025
 This project documents the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a low-power analog ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal acquisition circuit. The system captures heart activity and displays key waveform features such as P-waves, QRS complexes, and T-waves with low noise and high clarity.

 ### 2. [IoT-Based Smart Door Security & Monitoring System (ESP8266 + Web UI + Telegram Alerts)](https://github.com/milanbhat1/iot-door-security-system) -2025
  This IoT project that implements password-protected door access with real-time alerts and presence detection using an ESP8266.

 ### 3. [FIFO Block (Verilog HDL)](https://github.com/milanbhat1/FIFO) -2025
  This project presents the design, implementation, and simulation of a synchronous FIFO using Verilog HDL. It focuses on simple, hazard-free data access and reliable synchronization between write and read operations, using a single clock signal and an enable (en) signal to determine the operation mode.

 ### 4. [Electronic Organ Using Transistor](https://github.com/milanbhat1/Electronic_Organ) -2024
  This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a compact, cost-effective electronic organ using basic components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors. When a key is pressed, a specific frequency is generated to simulate a musical note, based on the Indian classical music scale (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni).

 ### 5. [Air Quality Monitor-STM32](https://github.com/milanbhat1/AirQualityMonitor-STM32) -2025
  This project presents a compact and cost-effective air quality monitoring device that detects gas concentration using the MQ-135 sensor and displays values in PPM (Parts Per Million) on an OLED screen. The STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) microcontroller reads analog sensor data, processes it through ADC, and displays it in real-time using I2C OLED interfacing.

 ### 6. [Battery Management System using STM32](https://github.com/milanbhat1/BatteryManagementSystem-STM32) -2025
  This project monitors battery voltage and current, calculates State of Charge (SOC), and displays real-time values on an OLED display. Audible and visual alerts are triggered during low SOC or abnormal current conditions.

## 1st yr:
  ### 1. [Plastic Segregation with Computer Vision](https://github.com/milanbhat1/plastic-waste-detection-opencv) -2024
  This project presents a computer vision-based system using YOLO, OpenCV, and Python to automate real-time plastic waste detection and classification.

   ### 2. [PARK-IT](https://github.com/milanbhat1/PARK-IT) -2023
  We designed and developed PARK-IT, a smart parking management application that simplifies the parking experience. Using Figma, we created an intuitive UI/UX that enables users to locate, reserve, and navigate to available parking spots in real time. Our design focuses on improving user convenience through live availability updates, smooth check-in/check-out flow, and integrated digital payment options.
